# About Me


Hello, everyone. I am Zhiyuan Yu. I was born in Anhui Hefei, where tradition meets progress. After living in Hefei for 18 years, I moved to the "true provincial capital" in the hearts of many Anhui residents, Jiangsu Nanjing, for my studies. 

## The origin of my name

    <span class="pull-left"><img src="images/Name.jpg" width="75px" height="75px"/></span>
    <div class="media-body">
        <div>My given name Zhiyuan (致远), is inspired by a phrase from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms: 'Be indifferent to fame and wealth to clarify one's aspirations (淡泊以明志), stay calm to achieve far-reaching goals (宁静而致远).' My grandfather was named after Mingzhi (明志), so I am named after Zhiyuan (致远).</div>

# Selected Research

**Z. Yu**, H. Ren, C. Pan, G. Zhou, B. Wang, M. Dong, J. Wang "Active RIS Aided ISAC Systems: Beamforming Design and Performance Analysis," in IEEE Trans. Commun., vol. 72, no. 3, pp. 1578-1595, Mar. 2024, doi: 10.1109/TCOMM.2023.3332856.

This is my first work from 2022.9 to 2023.11. Feeling fortunate to be accepted by IEEE TCOM. Hopefully, you find it intriguing to some extent!
