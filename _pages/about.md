About Me
======

Hello, everyone. I am Zhiyuan Yu. I was born in Anhui Hefei, where tradition meets progress. After living in Hefei for 18 years, I moved to the ``true provincial capital'' in the hearts of many Anhui residents, Jiangsu Nanjing, for my studies.

        <div><span style="font-weight: bold">The origin of my name</span></div>
        <div>My given name Zhiyuan (致远), is inspired by a phrase from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms: 'Be indifferent to fame and wealth to clarify one's aspirations (淡泊以明志), stay calm to achieve far-reaching goals (宁静而致远).' My grandfather was named after Mingzhi (明志), so I am named after Zhiyuan (致远).<div>

The space here is too limited for a comprehensive self-introduction. Feel free to add me on QQ: 1550287211.
