  abstract={This work considers a dual-functional radar and communication (DFRC) system with an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and a potential eavesdropper. Our purpose is to maximize the secrecy rate (SR) of the system by jointly designing the beamforming matrix at the DFRC base station (BS) and the reflecting coefficients at the active RIS, subject to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) constraint of the radar echo and the power consumption constraints at the DFRC-BS and active RIS. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm based on semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and majorization-minimization (MM) is applied to solve the SR-maximization problem by alternately optimizing the beamforming matrix and the reflecting coefficients. Specifically, we first apply the SDR and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods to transform the two subproblems into more tractable forms, then the MM method is applied to derive a concave surrogate function and iteratively solve the subproblems. Finally, simulation results indicate that the active RIS can better confront the impact of “multiplicative fading” and outperforms traditional passive RIS in terms of both secure data rate and radar sensing performance.},

  abstract={In this paper, we investigate an reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. Our objective is to maximize the achievable sum rate of the multi-antenna communication users through the joint active and passive beamforming. Weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) method is used to reformulate the original problem into an equivalent one. Then, we utilize an alternating optimization (AO) approach to separate the optimization variables and decompose this challenging problem into two subproblems. Given reflecting coefficients, a penalty-based algorithm is utilized to deal with the transmit power and the non-convex radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraints. For the given beamforming matrix of the BS, we apply majorization-minimization (MM) to transform the problem into a quadratic constraint quadratic programming (QCQP) problem, which is ultimately solved using a semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based algorithm. Simulation results illustrate the advantage of deploying RIS in the considered multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) ISAC systems.},

  abstract={Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a disruptive technology that can reconfigure wireless communication environments cost-effectively. In order to fully unveil the potential of RIS-aided wireless communications, some existing contributions considered the double cooperative passive RISs to achieve a higher capacity scaling orders. However, due to the multiplicative fading effect, the double cooperative passive RISs performs poorly when deployed far from the BS and user respectively. To address this issue, we investigate double cooperative active RISs which are equipped with amplifiers and can overcome the severe path loss caused by the multiplicative fading. Specifically, we aim to maximize the downlink achievable rate subject to the transmit power constraints of the base station (BS) and the double active RISs. The formulated problem is solved by using an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm based on the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm and the fractional programming (FP) method. Simulation results demonstrate that much better rate performance can be achieved by adopting active RIS compared to passive RIS in the double RIS-aided systems. Meanwhile, deploying them appropriately far away from the BS and user and more elements assigned to the active RIS near the user will achieve better performance.},

  abstract={This paper investigates a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)assisted integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC) system. In this paradigm, the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-enabled user equipments (UEs) simultaneously detect the target and offload the computational tasks of radar sensing to the edge computing server (ECS) through their communication functionality. To enhance the efficiency of computation offloading, we deploy an RIS to mitigate the high attenuation between UEs and the ECS. A latency minimization problem is investigated with constraints on UE’s transmit power, radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), RIS phase shift, and computation capability. We propose an algorithm based on the block coordinate descent (BCD) method to decouple the original problem into two subproblems, and then the computational and beamforming variables are optimized alternately utilizing efficient iterative algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.},
